# 🧠 Kata Lab — Problem Solving & Logic Playground

Welcome to my personal **kata lab** — a space where I practice problem solving, explore programming logic, and try new things in **Python, JavaScript, and PHP**.

This repo is my sandbox to:
- Sharpen my algorithmic thinking 🧩
- Practice clean code and test-driven development (TDD) 🧪
- Explore new syntax, methods, and problem-solving strategies 💡

## 🧪 Languages Used

- 🐍 **Python**
- 🟨 **JavaScript**
- 🐘 **PHP**
